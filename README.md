# About Me

Hi, I’m Idil with an MSc in Astrophysics & Cosmology from the University of Padova.

🔭 **From the Universe to Data**  
In astrophysics, I learned to model complex systems, analyze noisy data, and uncover hidden patterns—skills I’m eager to apply to real-world problems through data science. Whether studying galaxies or global trends, my goal is the same: to ask the right questions and find meaning in complexity.

🌍 **Beyond Science**  
I’m also a traveler, musician, and explorer—curious about the world both within and beyond the sciences. I’ve hitchhiked across countries, wild camped in nature, adapted to life abroad, and performed live as a musician, giving concerts along the way. These experiences shape how I learn, collaborate, and create.

🚀 **What’s Next?**  
I’m currently seeking Data Science roles in Europe. I'm also open to PhD opportunities in astrophysics and cosmology.
